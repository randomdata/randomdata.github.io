			<h2>New hackerspace location</h2>
		</header>
		<p>After years of corona and having a nomadic lifestyle, we finally have a location to call our own again. We have moved into what was previously "De Stadstuin" located at Europalaan 20.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/fulls/europalaan20.jpg" alt="" style="height:auto;max-width:100%" class="CToWUd a6T" tabindex="0" width="400"><br><span style="font-size:10px"><em>Space day at the new location</em></span></p>
		<p>That means that we're finally able to offer the perks that were available pre-corona, such as 24/7 access for members and the ability to refurnish the location according to our own wishes. The location is still labeled as "anti-kraak" and there are tentative plans for the building to be demolished in the future, but until then we effectively have a kingdom to ourselves.</p>
