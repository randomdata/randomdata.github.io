From 20 to 2 – A New Chapter at the Hackerspace

After years of tinkering, building, learning, and sharing at Europalaan 20, our Hackerspace has packed up its soldering irons, 3D printers, half-finished projects, and community spirit… and moved just down the road to Europalaan 2.

Our new (and possibly temporary) home is "De Alchemist" — a fitting name, considering the kind of creative magic we cook up here. From hardware hacks to software experiments, from late-night repairs to spontaneous workshops, the alchemy of curious minds continues, stronger than ever.

We’re excited to invite you to visit us during the upcoming Open Hackerspace Day. Whether you’re a seasoned maker, a curious neighbor, or just someone who likes blinking LEDs and half-broken robots, you’re very welcome to drop by, explore the space, and meet the crew.

Now, we’d be lying if we said things are going perfectly. The local government has thrown a bit of a wrench into things — tenants of De Alchemist are being asked to vacate the building on short notice due to complications with the landlord (more on that here). It’s frustrating, it’s messy… but it’s not the end.

Hackers adapt. Hackers rebuild. Hackers relocate, rewire, and reimagine.

No matter what happens next, the Hackerspace will survive — and thrive. We're already scouting for a new permanent home. Stay tuned for updates soon!

In the meantime, come visit us at De Alchemist. Let’s make some magic together while we still can.
